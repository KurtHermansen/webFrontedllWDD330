        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chapter 8: Forms</strong></li>
            <p>The use of forms is are a major part of webpages. It would be rare to build a site that would not have a form section in it somewhere. In this chapter of reading I really liked the section in turning input entries into a JSON object. This could be very useful when loading data into a database like MongoDB. They use a NoSQL format where data could be loaded as a JSON object. </p>
            <p>Data Validation is great to have in your frontend. You can turn off the scripting on the frontend which is why it is important to have data validation on the backend as well. But the data validation on the frontend is good because you can set up reactive inputs that change as requirements art met.</p>
            <li><strong>Chapter 12: Object Oriented Programming</strong></li>
            <p>Object Oriented Programming is a hard concept to fully understand. I took a who class on the programming with classes which covered these same topics but with the python programming language. In JavaScript is seems like it works pretty similar. You have to make a class and inside that class you have different objects that can be called to perform different functions. Using object oriented programming is a great way to make your code more flexible and reusable. It would be rough to write code for every process that happens on your site. When you use Object Oriented Programming you get to reuse function with different inputs and based off of those inputs it will generate different results. </p>
            <li><strong>Chapter 15: JavaScript Development (Modular JavaScript)</strong></li>
            <p>The use of modular JavaScript is a great way to write a static file that performs a very specific function so that it can be used multiple times. In the reading they give the example of square functions. You import the file and its function into a main.js file then you can reference them in the main.js file. </p>
