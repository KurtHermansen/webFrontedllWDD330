            <li><strong>Chapter 5: Objects</strong></li>
            <p>Objects are so useful. I don't think there has been a programming class that hasn't had a form of an object. This is a great way to store data with many attributes. This is called a name:value pair. Objects are great for storing many attributes about an object. for example you could have an object of student. then you could list all the information about that student (name, email, classes, GPA, major, degree, ect). In JavaScript you tap into the attributes by calling the object then use a period followed by the attribute "student.name". You can nest objects inside objects as well. For example "class.student.name". The best way to set up a JavaScript object is to use the JSON format. </p>
            <li><strong>Chapter 6: Document Object Model</strong></li>
            <p> Commonly known as DOM is a way to list all the HTML elements in JavaScript. this is useful to know how to tap into each element so that you can manipulate different aspects of the HTML DOM. You can call different parts of the DOM by using (document.getElementBy"....") you can select by class, id, or tag name. Once you have selected a HTML element you can update any part of that element including the CSS associated with that element. This is the real power of JavaScript. It is the best lauguage to create dynamic UI UX for a webpage. </p>
            <li><strong>Chapter 7: Events</strong></li>
            <p>Events are a great way to change a user experience by having your web page react to the users input like clicking, typing, or moving mouse. Events are a main building block to creating reactive web pages for a great user experience.</p>
