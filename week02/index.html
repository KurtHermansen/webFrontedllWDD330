            <li><strong>Ch2: Programming Basics</strong></li>
            <p>Programming Basics was a review for the most part. I have taken a handful of python programming classes so I know what type of variables there are and how to bind them to one another. My major concern is making sure syntax is correct in JavaScript. Python is a very easy and flexible language with very relaxed syntax practices. I don't feel like JavaScript is as relaxed. </p>
            <li><strong>Ch3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</strong></li>
            <p>Once again Arrays, Logic and Loops are a very big part of programming in python so most of this is a surface review. I have gone in to much more detail while programming in python. ust like I stated above it will be getting the specific syntax right that will be the hardest part. </p>
            <li><strong>Ch4: Functions</strong></li>
            <p>Functions are covered in python as well but most python functions will have specific returns. With JavaScript you will be doing things to the DOM. While building and running functions in JavaScript I know I need to keep the end goal in mind. So that I don't go down a rabbit hole of building a function that ultimately doesn't work. I find what works best for me is to start simple to make sure basic function works then add complexity gradually so that debugging is easy. </p>
