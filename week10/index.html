            <li><strong>MDN: Validating Forms</strong></li>
            <p>HTML Form validation properties are a nice start to client-side validation. Although all client side validation can be bypassed it is still nice to let users know that there data is valid or invalid before they submit to the server. Having CSS to indicate correct/incorrect input field is great. Most users will make honest mistakes when using inputs and having visual indications will save a time on there side figuring out what they did wrong.</p>
            <p>JavaScript Validation is a great way to add customization to client side validation. I can see why this would be far better that just HTML input validation. You can add better error handling messages that apply to your overall feel of your web design. Also they bring up a great point in the reading about how the HTML responses might not be in the right language. This would be a major problem in production. </p>
            <li><strong>MDN: Using Fetch</strong></li>
            <p>Supplying your own request object is a great way to use the fetch() property. YOu can build your own request and fetch it they way you want. I had never thought you could use fetch() in this way. I thought it was just used for reaching out to outside API data. It still is a little unclear to me how and when to use all the different fetch() properties but I hope to explore this more while building my final application. I have this chapter bookmarked and will be returning when I get to the fetch section of my application. </p>
