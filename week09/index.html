            <li><strong>Chapter 9: The Window Object</strong></li>
            <p>
                I like the alert(), prompt() and confirm() methods. I used a confirm method in my todo app. These are pretty handy for confirming a step in a process. But as stated in the reading these actions completely stop your program so it cannot rely on any other processes. I'm sure if I were to use the window.location object it would be for data collection. I think the window.location is used by the browser to navigate pages. 
            </p>  
            <p>Cookies are in interesting topic within JavaScript. I can see there utility. It is handy to have information about a user or session that will stay with the user each time they visit a web page or until the cookie is destroyed. The main use of this would be for a shopping cart. It would not be in a the best interest of a e commerce store to clear a shopping cart every time the browser is closed. This makes it easier to make a sale if a cookie of previous shopping is saved.</p>
            <li><strong>Chapter 14: HTML5 API's</strong></li>
            <p>
                This chapter covers the data- attribute really well. I was a little confused at the beginning of the semester about this attribute and how it works. After reading this chapter it is clearer to me. I like how you can set many data- attributes on HTML tags and use them to create a json object if you wanted to. Once you have some data set the use of local storage is a great way to keep that data. I never considered a local storage option with web apps. I always thought that any information that was stored on a web app would be stored in a Database somewhere. Local storage is a great tool to utilize with users that don't interact with model side of a web app.

            <p>Web Workers and Web Sockets are something I have heard about but have no experience with. I need to build an application that uses them to have them make more sense to me. </p>
