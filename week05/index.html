            <li><strong>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</strong></li>
            <p>Having errors in code is a completely normal process. The trick is finding all the errors and fixing them. Learning about the "Use Strict" mode in JavaScript is a great way to start debugging code because it will look for bad code practices as well. I have used ESlint before to make sure my code is formatted correctly on VS code. When I took Backend 2 last spring we built node.js apps and ran npm installs for everything. I was thinking that it would be a good idea to run the same for the frontend JavaScript as well. When you run your code on the live server you can see your errors in the terminal that will give you a better idea of why it is failing. I think I will use npm server to run my frontend projects from now on. I don't care for the console debugging tool on Google Chrome.</p>
            <p>Building your own code to handle errors is pretty new to me. I have built custom error messages with node.js and attached messages to them within an try catch and if else statements. I have never used a "throw" method though. I think that it is great to write code that will throw an error when it meets a certain criteria. Another way to write code that will throw errors is writing .test files and just Jest. I did use Jest in my backend 2 class but the test files were very complex and didn't make much sense to me. The example that is covered in the reading is great but a little to simple to understand what jest can do. I want to know if programmers really use testing files to check there code or do they just built there code until they don't have any noticeable errors? For me I think building a good test file might be harder that writing the original file. So whose to say your test code doesn't need a test code to make sure it will run right??</p>
