            <li><strong>Syllabus</strong></li>
            <p>I am having trouble getting into Site Point for all the content. It seems like the link is broken on the syllabus. I will keep trying to get my access code I was able to view a short video about master Mobile UX. So for now I think I am good. </p>
            <li><strong>Doing Stuff with Web Things</strong></li>
            <p>This is a review for me and it was good to have a review and know where our skill level should be at starting this class. It has been a little while since I've used JavaScript on the frontend.  </p>
            <li><strong>Master Mobile UX</strong></li>
            <p>I feel like this "mobile first" approach has been drummed into me since my first web development class. So I think I understand the necessity of the point made in the video. I prefer to make web views that fit phones. I feel like the flow so mush better than desktop views. I work off a very large monitor and I am always struggling to fill the screen. So it feels like I am flowing things horizontally when I want to flow things vertically. Almost the exact opposite of what you wat to do. </p>
